# Coin Combinations

Have you noticed those coin slides used by modern cash registers that automatically give the correct amount of change? Build a Sinatra website that lets a user enter an amount of cents and shows the smallest number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to make that change. Again, before you begin creating any webpages, make sure you build the method with good, clear specs first, code that passes the specs. and any necessary refactoring.
